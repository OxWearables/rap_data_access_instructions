# Description:
## What is this file?
This file provides **instructions for using the RAP Table Exporter tool to pull UK Biobank data for an analysis**.

This method is best used when you want to add a few variables to a project, but is probably not the best method for pulling large datasets. For pulling datasets that contain many variables, use the instructions found in the /data_access_instructions/ folder that describe pulling data using Jupyter lab notebooks. 

Step 1. Load cohort data in Data Preview
In the main project folder, you can find the main dataset file (format looks like app59070.... .dataset)which contains the base cohort of 502,415 participants. Click on this file to load the dataset in the cohort browser Data Preview. A cohort browser Data Preview window will open where you can see the variables included in this dataset.

Step 2. Add variables of interest
Click the 'Data Preview' tab on the left then click on 'Add column' on the right. Search through the available variables and choose the variables from the folders that are shown on the left. Click on 'Add to data preview' to add it to your data preview window (e.g. body mass index). You should now see the column in your data preview window. 

* Note - A note on instances and array indices: Variables in UK Biobank come with instances and array indices. For most variables with instancing, repeat 1 refers to a resurvey among a limited number of participants and repeat 2 is the imaging visit. Both apply only to a subset of participants. More importantly, some variables have multiple items, as participants could give multiple answers (e.g. employment history) or had multiple measurements taken at a single visit (e.g. blood pressure measurements).*

To remove a variable column, click the grid icon (reads 'Customize Columns' when you hover over it). Click the '-' symbol next to the variable that you want to be removed.

Step 3. Add a filter to the cohort (optional)
Additionally, filters can be applied to show only participants with certain characteristics (e.g., only females). To add a filter, click on the 'Add Filter' button next to the cohort’s name and choose the variable as well as the value (e.g., sex, female to include only females). To remove the filter, either click on the small x visible next to the individual filter OR click on Clear All Filters to remove all filters (brings you back to the baseline cohort of 502,415 participants)

Step 4. Save your cohort
Once all filters are set and all variables needed have been added as columns, you can save the cohort by clicking on the 'Save' sign in the top right corner.

Type a name for your cohort and change the location of the cohort to be in your user's folder (/users/YOURNAME). Don’t forget to document the datasets you prepare and keep the folders you have as clean as you can. The RAP system helps with documentation - but there’s nothing more frustrating than coming back to a dataset and not knowing what’s in it or why.

Step 5. Exporting the cohort / dataset to csv
First, you need to create a csv file. Click on the 'Projects' tab at the top of the window to return to the main RAP project. Navigate to your personal folder where you stored your cohort. Click 'Start Analysis' in the upper right corner.

Scroll down to 'Table exporter' from the list of apps and click on the 'Run Selected' button in the bottom right. A new window should open. *Note - If this is the first time you have run Table Exporter, you'll be prompted to install it first!*

Within the Table Exporter app, open the 'Analysis Inputs 1' tab on the right side of the screen. Then click the 'Dataset or Cohort or Dashboard' tile.

You can export the data in different formats. UKB variables have field numbers, as well as names, and categorical variables, are stored as numbers to reduce the size of the dataset. To download a csv file with variable names and variable coding already done, choose the output file format as csv, coding option REPLACE and header style FIELD NAME.

Click on 'Start Analysis' on the top right

Once the conversion finishes and the file is ready, you will be notified via email. To access the file, either return to your project or click the link in the email.

Step 6. Use the csv on the VM
Your csv is now ready for use on the VM!
